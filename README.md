# Optimal Sampling & Scheduling for Remote Fusion Estimation

**Project Page for Allerton 2025 Conference Paper**

## Abstract

In distributed sensor networks, sensors often observe a dynamic process within overlapping regions. Due to random delays, these correlated observations arrive at the fusion center asynchronously. This project addresses the joint design of sampling, scheduling, and estimation policies for monitoring a correlated Wiener process.

We establish a **separation principle** and identify the joint optimal policy:

1. **Estimator:** Weighted-sum fusion conditioned on Age of Information (AoI).
    
2. **Scheduler:** Maximum Age First (MAF).
    
3. **Sampler:** Threshold-triggered Water-Filling policy.
